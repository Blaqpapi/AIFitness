## Technologies Used

*   **Backend:** Python
*   **Web Framework:** Streamlit
*   **AI Integration:** Groq API (with `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` model)
*   **Database:** SQLite
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas
*   **Charting:** Altair
*   **Environment Variables:** python-dotenv

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Fitness Coach locally:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.8 or higher.
    *   `pip` (Python package installer).
    *   Git (for cloning the repository).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd aifitnessProj # Or your project directory name
    ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    The application requires a Groq API key to interact with the AI model.
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project (`aifitnessProj/`).
    *   Add your Groq API key to the `.env` file:
        ```env
        GROQ_API_KEY="your_actual_groq_api_key"
        ```
    *   You can obtain a Groq API key from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).

6.  **Database Initialization:**
    The SQLite database (`fitness_data.db`) and its necessary tables will be automatically created (if they don't exist) when you first run the application, thanks to the `init_db()` function.

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run ai_fitness.py
```

This will typically open the application in your default web browser (e.g., at `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage

### 1. Profile Management

*   **Creating a New Profile:**
    *   In the sidebar, expand the "Create New Profile" section.
    *   Enter a name for the new profile and click "Create Profile".
    *   The new profile will be created and automatically selected. You can then update its details.
*   **Selecting an Active Profile:**
    *   Use the "Active Profile" dropdown in the sidebar to switch between existing profiles.
    *   The chat history, logs, and settings will update to reflect the selected profile.
*   **Updating Profile Settings:**
    *   Once a profile is active, its settings will be displayed in the sidebar under "Settings for '<Profile Name>'".
    *   Modify fields like "Primary Goal," "Experience Level," "Age," "Sex," "Height (cm)," "Weight (kg)," "Activity Level," "Dietary Preferences," "Available Equipment," and "General Notes."
    *   Changes are saved automatically when you interact with other UI elements or when the "Save Profile Details" button (if explicitly added for a save action) is clicked.
*   **Deleting a Profile:**
    *   Expand the "Delete Active Profile" section in the sidebar.
    *   Click the "Delete <Profile Name>" button. A confirmation might be required.
    *   Note: You cannot delete the last remaining profile.

### 2. Interacting with the AI Coach

*   The main area of the application features a chat interface.
*   Type your fitness, nutrition, or motivation-related questions into the input box at the bottom ("Ask about exercise form, healthy meals, motivation...") and press Enter.
*   The AI will respond based on its `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and the context of your current profile (if applicable to the query).
*   Chat history is saved and loaded per profile.

### 3. Logging Activities and Weigh-ins

*   Below the main chat interface, find the "üìù Log Activity / Weigh-in" section.
*   **Log Type:** Choose "Workout," "Weight," or "General Note."
*   **Notes:** Enter details about your workout, any specific observations, or general thoughts.
*   **Weight (kg):** If logging a "Weight" entry, provide your current weight. This field is hidden for other log types.
*   Click "Log Entry" to save the record.

### 4. Viewing Progress

*   **Recent Logs:** The "Recent Activity & Notes" section displays your latest log entries for the active profile.
*   **Weight Chart:** The "Weight Progress (kg)" section shows an interactive line chart of your logged weights over time for the active profile.
*   **BMI:** If height and weight are provided in the profile, your BMI will be calculated and displayed in the "Biometrics" section of the sidebar.

### 5. Generating Fitness Schedules

*   The application can generate a 4-week fitness schedule tailored to your profile. This may happen automatically upon profile creation/update or by clicking the "üîÑ Regenerate Schedule Suggestion" button in the sidebar.
*   The generated schedule will appear as a message from the AI in the chat interface.

## Database

*   The application uses an SQLite database named `fitness_data.db` stored in the project's root directory.
*   This database stores:
    *   `profiles`: User profile information (ID, name, goals, biometrics, preferences, etc.).
    *   `chat_history`: Messages exchanged with the AI coach, linked to specific profiles.
    *   `logs`: Workout, weight, and general note entries, linked to specific profiles.
*   The database is automatically initialized if it doesn't exist on startup.

## AI Integration

*   The AI coaching capabilities are provided by the Groq API, utilizing the `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` model (or as configured in `GROQ_MODEL`).
*   A detailed `SYSTEM_PROMPT` (defined in `ai_fitness.py`) guides the AI's persona, capabilities, and response style, ensuring it acts as a knowledgeable, encouraging, and safe fitness coach.
*   The Groq client is cached for efficiency.
